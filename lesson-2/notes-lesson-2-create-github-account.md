Demonstrate creation of GitHub.com account.

Usually you will create a free GitHub account unless you are planning on creating private repositories. If you are writing code for a company, you will likely be added to that company's GitHub.com organization and will create private repositories in that organization and you will not need anything more than your free GitHub.com account.
